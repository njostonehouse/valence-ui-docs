Valence UI (also known as "VUI") is a set of libraries that you can use to create and style UI components for your app so that you get the same look and behavior as native D2L applications.

## Where do I get VUI?

The VUI components are available as [NPM modules](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/keyword/vui), so you'll need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) to install the components. To learn more, see [Getting Started]({{ '/getting-started' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.github.url }}).

## What's available in VUI?
To see what's available, visit [Components]({{ '/components' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.github.url }}).

## What's changed in VUI?

To see what's changed in any of the VUI components, view the _Releases_ section in the component's Github repository (for example,  [valence-ui-field releases](https://github.com/Brightspace/valence-ui-field/releases)). To see what's changed in the VUI documentation, see [Valence-UI-Docs releases](https://github.com/Brightspace/valence-ui-docs/releases).
