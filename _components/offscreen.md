The [vui-offscreen](https://github.com/Brightspace/valence-ui-offscreen) library provides mixins and CSS for positioning elements off the screen.

Off-screen elements are valuable from an accessibility perspective when you want to have elements that are hidden to sighted users while being recognizable for screen reader users. However, you should make sure to apply off-screen to the correct elements. If you hide elements that receive focus, this might confuse sighted users because they will not be able to see which element has focus.

## Styling with Sass

If you're familiar with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), you can use our mixins to position elements off-screen . Import and include the `vui-offscreen` mixin in your CSS selector.

Scss:

{% highlight css %}
@import '<npm module path>/vui-offscreen/offscreen';

.offscreen {
	@include vui-offscreen;
}
{% endhighlight %}

HTML:

{% highlight html %}
<p class="offscreen">
	This text will only be visible to screen readers.
</p>
{% endhighlight %}

## Styling with CSS

If you'd prefer to use CSS to style lists, bundle the provided **offscreen.css** file with your application's CSS. Then apply the `.vui-offscreen` class to your element.

{% highlight html %}
<p class="vui-offscreen">
	This text will only be visible to screen readers.
</p>
{% endhighlight %}
